            <p>
                It is important that our classes are a safe and comfortable space for
                everyone taking part. Treat your fellow classmates with respect, including
                respecting their personal space and their belongings. Not everyone will be
                comfortable with physical contact in a scene or a warm up so please be
                mindful of people’s boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated and students may be asked to
                leave class. Inappropriate conduct includes, but is not limited to: using
                drugs or alcohol during class, causing damage to the venue, and
                inappropriate verbal, physical or sexual conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or ableism
                from students in or out of improv scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please do not use your phone in class, unless for taking notes. Students are
                asked to support their fellow classmates by not talking during scenes or
                when a teacher is giving feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think that there is anything your teacher needs to know to make you
                more comfortable or to make any accommodations for you, you can get in touch
                before the course via email.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should wear clothes and shoes that you’ll be comfortable moving around
                in and should bring some water. There is a comfort break in the middle of
                the class.

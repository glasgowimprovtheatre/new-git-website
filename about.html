        <p>Our goal is to help nurture the budding improv scene in Glasgow by providing structured training and performance opportunities.</p>
        <p>
            We focus on American-style long form improv comedy, with a strong emphasis on game-of-the-scene and grounded reality.
        </p>
        <p>The theatre is a continuation of Improv Glasgow, which started in 2016 running the monthly show Glasgow Harold Night as well as drop-in workshops and jams.</p>
